# GITHUB-Analysis-Mercor

### Github Automated Analysis Project Overview:
In this project, you will build a Python-based tool that, when given a GitHub user's name, returns the most technically complex and challenging repository from that user's profile. The tool will use GPT and LangChain to assess each repository individually before determining the most technically challenging one.

The following features are used to determine the most complex repository among the repository present on GitHub of that user:

1. Cyclomatic Complexity: Measures the complexity of the code's control flow.
2. Coupling Score: Evaluates the interdependence between components within the repository.
3. Cohesion Score: Assesses the degree of relatedness among elements in the codebase.
4. Issue Complexity: Analyzes the complexity and depth of the repository's issues.
5. Code Smells Score: Identifies potential code quality issues and anti-patterns.
6. Documentation Score: Gauges the comprehensiveness and clarity of the documentation.
7. Technical Debt Score: Highlights the accumulated technical debt within the repository.
8. Contributor Activity Score: Measures the level of engagement and contributions from collaborators.
9. Stargazers Count: Indicates the popularity and interest in the repository.
10. Forks Count: Reflects the number of times the repository has been forked by others.
11. Size: Takes into account the overall size of the repository.
